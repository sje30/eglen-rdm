# Inverse problems are hard


| Score (%) | grade |
|:---------:|:-----:|
| 70-100    |    A  |
| 60-69     |    B  |
| 50-59     |    C  |
| 40-49     |    D  |
| 0-39      |    F  |


### Forward problem

I scored 68, what was my grade?

### Inverse problem

I got a B, what was my score?

# Where is the scholarship?

> An article about computational science in a scientific publication
> is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the
> scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software
> development environment and that complete set of instructions that
> generated the figures.

[Buckheit and Donoho 1995, after Claerbout]

# Selfish reasons to share

Why not align what is good for science with what is good for
scientists?


1. Funding mandates (REF + enforcement from Wellcome Trust)
2. Credit through data papers
3. Leads to further collaborations (e.g. "EPAmeadev")
4. Fixes data bugs / errors in analysis
5. Prevents data loss [(Vines et al 2014)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24361065). e.g. students have a habit of leaving...
6. Your future self is probably one of the main beneficiaries of
   sharing.
7. *Now* is a very good time to be an open scientist.

# Specific recommendations

1. Include enough code to reproduce key figure/result from your paper
   ("modeldb").
2. Provide toy examples if your project is too intensive to expect
   others to run in a few hours.
3. Version control (github)
4. Licence (MIT)
5. Provide data
6. Provide tests
7. Use standards 
8. Use permanent URLs (Zenodo/figshare)

# Other practical tips

* Lobby journals about their code-sharing practices.  [Go Elife!](https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/c8ca56de/innovation-collaborating-to-devise-the-future-executable-article)
* Lobby funders likewise.
* When reviewing articles, ask for code/data to be made available.
* When starting on a new project, assume code will be public at some
  point in the future.
